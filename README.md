# Bitcoin Price Display

A simple API call that requests the price of bitcoin from an API server and displays it on a screen. Programmed in MicroPython on a Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W.

## My Resources

- Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W
  (any microcontroller with network access and MicroPython support should be acceptable)
- Waveshare 2.3" 128 x 32 OLED HAT display
  (connected via 4-pin SPI, however I2C should also work)
- Socket-to-pin wires
  (7 wires for the 7 pins on the screen)
